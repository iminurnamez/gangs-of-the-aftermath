#How to Play (I ran out of time for a tutorial):

The objective of the game is to take control of all the neighborhoods of Aftermath City by managing your gang and attacking enemy gangs.

##Controls

In general, left click to select or press a button, right click to close menus

F - toggle fullscreen

##Units

There are four types of units

Worker - Workers will wander into your territories periodically and join your gang. Workers can be trained and equipped to create the other unit types.

Scavengers - Each turn scavengers will scour the neighborhood they're assigned to looking for resources.

Soldier - Better at defense than attack

Raiders - Better attack than defense


##Taking Over Territories

Clicking on an adjacent enemy-controlled territory gives you the option to attack that territory. All of your
 unassigned Soldiers and Raiders will participate in the attack against all the units assigned to that territory. After
 each round of attacking you are given the option to press the attack or retreat. Killing all the territory's defenders will give you control of the territory.

##Defending Territories

If one of your territories is attacked by one of the other gangs all the units assigned to that territory will participate in the fight to defend it. This means
 it's best to have all of your units assigned to your territories when not training new units or attacking.

##Assigning Units

Click on one of your territories and use the relevant buttons to assign or unassign units from the territory.
